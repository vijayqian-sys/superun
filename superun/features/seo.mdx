superun bakes thoughtful SEO defaults into every page and component. This guide explains how superun optimizes your project for search engines and how you can further enhance discoverability.

## Automatic SEO Features

superun applies the following SEO optimizations automatically across all generated pages:

* Keep `<title>` tags concise (~60 characters) with primary keywords  
* Write meta descriptions (~160 characters) based on page intent and natural keyword usage  
* Ensure exactly one `<h1>` per page  
* Structure content with semantic HTML elements  
* Add descriptive, keyword-relevant image alt text  
* Add JSON-LD structured data for public-facing review widgets, listings, and detail pages when applicable  
* Lazy-load images and defer non-critical scripts  
* Automatically generate canonical URLs  
* Apply mobile-first responsive layouts with correct viewport settings  
* Use clean, human-readable URLs  
* Automatically apply SEO metadata (title, description, canonical) to AI-generated pages  
* Apply `noindex` to internal system pages (Analytics, Reports, Settings, Team, Integrations) to prevent indexing of administrative routes  
* Automatically include Open Graph metadata from your **Website Info** settings (Title, Description, OG Image)

These optimizations ensure your project follows modern SEO best practices with minimal manual configuration.

## Website Info (Global SEO Settings)

Under **Launch → SEO**, you can configure global metadata for your project:

* **Website Title** — Used in `<title>` and Open Graph tags  
* **Description** — Used for page-level meta descriptions and social sharing  
* **Image (OG Image)** — Displayed when your site is shared on social media  
* **Icon** — Used for browser tabs and bookmarks  

These values propagate across all generated pages and help create consistent metadata for search engines.

## Generating SEO Files

superun makes it easy to create essential SEO files (`robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`) directly from the interface:

1. Click **“Launch”** in the top navigation bar.
2. In the left sidebar, select **“SEO”**.
3. Under **SEO File**, click **“Generate”** next to `robots.txt` or `sitemap.xml`.

These files enable search engines to crawl and index your project efficiently.

### `robots.txt`
Controls which pages search engines can access.

### `sitemap.xml`
Provides a complete list of public-facing URLs for search engine indexing.

Both files update automatically when your project structure changes.

## Built-in Page Speed Optimization

Performance diagnostics have moved to the **Performance** tab under **Launch**.

superun includes a built-in speed audit powered by Google Lighthouse to identify opportunities for:

* Faster page rendering  
* Better SEO scoring  
* Improved accessibility  
* Optimized user experience  

To run the audit:

1. Click **“Launch”** → **Performance**  
2. Review Lighthouse category scores  
3. Use **Try to fix** to apply recommended improvements  

This ensures your site performs well on mobile and desktop, improving both SEO and overall usability.

## Tips and Tricks

<Accordion title="Sitemap for Search Engine Indexing">
A sitemap helps search engines discover and index your website efficiently.

1. Go to **Launch → SEO** and click **“Generate”** next to `sitemap.xml`.
2. Submit your sitemap in Google Search Console to improve crawling:
   `https://yourdomain/sitemap.xml`
3. The sitemap reference is automatically included inside `robots.txt` when both files are generated.

To verify manually:  
`curl https://yourdomain/sitemap.xml`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Robots.txt Configuration for Search Control">
`robots.txt` tells search engines which areas of your site they should or should not crawl.

1. Go to **Launch → SEO** and click **“Generate”**.
2. The default configuration allows all pages except system pages that superun marks as `noindex`.

Example:
```txt
User-agent: *
Allow: /
Sitemap: https://yourdomain/sitemap.xml
