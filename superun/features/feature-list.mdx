## Overview

The Project Feature List appears in the **Build** stage.

It is a **project-specific set of feature suggestions** generated based on your idea, design choices, and current structure. Each project has a different Project Feature List.

Its purpose is to help you quickly improve and complete your product.

## How It Works

superun analyzes your project and suggests features that can:

- Enhance existing pages and interactions  
- Add commonly needed sections or detail pages  
- Enable backend-powered functionality  

You can select individual features or choose **Select All** to apply all recommended improvements.

## What Happens After Selection

When you apply features, superun may:

- Add or expand pages  
- Improve content structure  
- Enable required backend capabilities  

All changes are generated automatically and can be refined afterward.

## When to Use It

Use the Project Feature List when your product structure is ready and you want to:

- Fill in missing details  
- Improve usability and completeness  
- Prepare your project for launch
