## Overview

After you submit your initial prompt, superun may ask you a short list of follow-up questions.

These questions help superun better understand **what you want to build** before generating your project.

## How It Works

- superun presents a small set of questions in a list  
- You answer them directly-no technical knowledge required  
- Your answers are combined with your original prompt  

Based on this information, superun forms a clearer understanding of your product and prepares the project accordingly.

---

## What Happens Next

Once you complete the questions:
- superun finalizes your project idea  
- The product structure and direction are defined  
- You move on to the **Design Options** stage

This step helps reduce rework later and leads to better results from the start.

## Idea page 

The Idea page is a summarized view of your project concept.

Based on your initial prompt and the answers you provided, superun organizes your thoughts into **a clear, readable project definition**, covering what you’re building, who it’s for, and the overall direction.

This page is designed for review and alignment. You can read through your idea at any time, and if something doesn’t feel right, you can freely edit and refine it.

Even as you move through Preview, Build, and Launch, the Idea page is always editable.
