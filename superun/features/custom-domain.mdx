You can publish your superun project on a custom domain to improve branding and SEO.

## Why use a custom domain

- Consistent branding looks more professional
- Better for search indexing
- Easier to remember and share

## Requirements

- Own a domain
- Use platforms like Vercel/Netlify for hosting and automatic certificates

## Connect your domain（Ex：Vercel）

1. Connect your project to Vercel
2. Add the domain under Vercel Domains
3. Follow the DNS instructions (e.g., CNAME to `cname.vercel-dns.com`)
4. Wait for SSL issuance (minutes to a few hours)

## Other providers

- Netlify: import repo → domain management → follow DNS guide
- Namecheap + GitHub Pages: host on GitHub and configure A/CNAME per guide

## FAQ

- Domain connected but not accessible: check DNS propagation (dnschecker), ensure DNS‑only mode, verify SSL issued
- Subdomains supported: yes—enter a subdomain in the connection flow
- SSL: hosting providers typically handle issuance and renewals automatically
