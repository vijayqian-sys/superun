  width="800"
/>

**Action options**:

1. **Matches expectations, start generation directly**
   - If the page steps match your expectations, you can directly click the "Start Generation" button
   - The system will proceed with the generation flow based on these steps

2. **Doesn't match expectations, but unsure how to describe**
   - If it doesn't match your expectations but you're unsure how to describe the issue
   - You can click the "Not sure yet" button
   - The model will provide you with new options to choose from

3. **Have your own ideas, want to adjust**
   - If you have your own ideas about the page steps or need adjustments
   - You can directly input your requirements in the dialog box
   - The model will combine your description and generate new options

> 💡 **Tip**: Make full use of the requirement clarification stage to make subsequent generation more aligned with your expectations. If unsatisfied, don't rush to continue—clarify first, then proceed to the next step.

> 💡 **Tip**: The demo version is a great way to quickly validate design and functionality. Before generating the full application, understanding how the application works through the demo version can help you better adjust your requirements.

#### When there's a bug, don't let AI thrash—understand first, then fix

When the site has errors or hangs, understand the problem before fixing—don't edit blindly.

**Common situations**:
- Site errors or hangs—try Fix a few times (click the Fix button); it usually resolves itself
- Refreshing won't lose data; the model can be unstable—the work is done but the page hasn't updated

**The right debug flow**:
1. **Understand the issue**: Copy the error and ask AI: "What does this mean? Where might the problem be?"
2. **Confirm approach**: Discuss possible solutions with AI
3. **Then fix**: Have AI make changes only after you've confirmed the approach

**Avoid**:
- ❌ Asking AI to randomly change things as soon as you see an error
- ❌ Modifying without analyzing the problem
- ❌ Making multiple changes in a row that make things worse

**Do this instead**:
- ✅ Understand the error message first
- ✅ Analyze the root cause
- ✅ Plan the fix
- ✅ Then execute the change

---

#### Use version history rollback

If your project has issues or you want to return to a previous stable state, use version history rollback.

**Use cases**:
- Recent changes broke functionality
- Want to return to a previous stable version
- Compare different version effects
- Test different implementations

**Steps**:
1. Go to your project's version history page
2. Review all version records
3. Select the target version to roll back to
4. Click "Rollback to this version" or "Restore this version"
5. Confirm the rollback
6. System will restore to the selected version state

**Notes**:
- Rollback will lose all changes between current and target versions
- After rollback, you can continue building from the restored state
- If your project is connected to a database, watch for data compatibility issues

> 💡 **Tip**: Create version pins frequently so you can quickly roll back to stable states when needed.

---

### Prompt Writing Tips

---

#### Use chat mode to think through structure first, then let AI build

Think before you build—don't generate everything at once.

**The right flow**:

**Step 1: Chat first (click Ask in the input box)**:
- Discuss ideas
- Think through structure
- Ask "Does this make sense?"
- Confirm direction and details

**Step 2: Then execute**:
- Have AI generate or modify
- Build based on the discussion
- Ensure direction is correct

**Benefits**:
- Avoid generating things that don't match your needs
- Save Credits (chat mode uses fewer Credits)
- Catch issues early
- Clearer thinking

> 💡 **Tip**: Regularly organize and update these patterns to build your own best practices library.

---

### Database Integration Tips

---

#### Validate database schema before rollback

Validate database schema compatibility before rolling back to avoid data issues from incompatible versions.

**Validation steps**:
1. Check current database schema
2. Compare with target version schema
3. Check for breaking changes
4. Migrate data first if needed

**Ask AI example**:
```
Validate the database schema at the current version and ensure there are no breaking changes.
Compare differences between current and target versions.
```

---

### Version Management Tips

#### Pin each known-good state

superun automatically records version history at each important milestone—no need to manually create version tags.

**How it works**:
- After you complete an important feature or make changes, the system automatically creates a record in version history
- Each version contains the complete project state and can be viewed or rolled back anytime

![Version History](https://b.ux-cdn.com/uxarts/files/t20260116115236/swkqgi3g.png)

**Best practices**:
1. After completing an important feature, test to ensure it works
2. The system automatically saves the current state to version history
3. View all milestone records in version history

**Benefits**:
- Roll back to any historical version anytime
- Easily compare differences between versions
- Automatic project progress tracking—no manual management needed

> 💡 **Tip**: Version history is saved automatically. Just focus on development, and the system manages all version records for you.

---

#### Use version diffs to locate issues

When issues arise, quickly pinpoint the problem by comparing differences between versions.

**Steps**:
1. Go to your project's version history page
2. Select two versions to compare (usually a stable version before the issue and the current problematic version)
3. Review the diff list—the system highlights all changes
4. Identify potential problem points based on the changes
5. Fix targeted issues

**Tips**:
- When comparing, choose versions with a smaller time gap to make it easier to locate issues
- Focus on recently modified files and feature modules
- For complex issues, compare multiple versions step by step to narrow down the problem

> 💡 **Tip**: The version comparison feature clearly shows changes in code, configuration, and structure, making it an effective tool for troubleshooting.

---

#### Use version rollback when stuck in error loops

When your project is stuck in error loops or becomes messy, use version rollback to quickly return to a previous stable state.

**Use cases**:
- Messy project structure that's hard to fix
- Too many errors with high fix costs
- Want to try a new approach, need to restart from a stable version
- Need to return to a version where everything worked

**Steps**:
1. Go to your project's version history page
2. Review all version records and find a stable version where everything worked
3. Select the target version
4. Click "Restore this version"
5. Confirm the rollback
6. The system automatically restores to the selected version state
7. Continue development from the stable version

**Notes**:
- ⚠️ **Important**: Rollback will lose all changes between the current and target versions. Proceed with caution.
- If your project is connected to a database, check data compatibility before rolling back to avoid schema mismatches
- After rollback, you can continue making new changes from this stable base

> ⚠️ **Note**: Check database connection compatibility before rolling back.

### Development Tools Tips

#### html2canvas element alignment fix

When using html2canvas, elements may misalign compared to browser rendering.

**The problem**:
html2canvas element alignment differs from actual browser rendering.

**Solution: Dynamic CSS injection**

Fix alignment by injecting temporary fix styles and controlling render parameters.

```javascript
const exportElement = async () => {
  // 1. Inject fix styles
  const style = document.createElement('style');
  style.id = 'export-fix-style';
  document.head.appendChild(style);
  
  if (style.sheet) {
    style.sheet.insertRule('* { box-sizing: border-box !important; }', 0);
    style.sheet.insertRule('img { display: inline-block !important; }', 1);
    style.sheet.insertRule('div { box-sizing: border-box !important; line-height: 1.2 !important; }', 2);
    style.sheet.insertRule('span { line-height: 1.2 !important; }', 3);
  }
  
  try {
    // 2. Wait for resources (images + fonts)
    await Promise.all([
      ...document.images.map(img => 
        img.complete ? Promise.resolve() : new Promise(resolve => {
          img.onload = img.onerror = resolve;
        })
      ),
      document.fonts.ready // Wait for fonts to load
    ]);
    
    // 3. Capture screenshot (key config below)
    const canvas = await html2canvas(element, {
      scale: 3, // High-res scaling
      foreignObjectRendering: false, // Disable foreignObject, use traditional rendering for stability
      useCORS: true, // Allow cross-origin images
      allowTaint: true // Allow tainted canvas (works with useCORS for cross-origin)
    });
    
    return canvas.toDataURL('image/png', 1.0); // Return PNG data
  } finally {
    // 4. Clean up temporary styles (ensure removal even on errors)
    document.getElementById('export-fix-style')?.remove();
  }
};
```

**Key configuration**:

| Parameter                  | Recommended Value | Purpose                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `foreignObjectRendering`   | `false`           | Disable `foreignObject` rendering, use traditional Canvas drawing to avoid alignment issues from SVG rendering differences |
| `box-sizing`               | `border-box`      | Unified box model calculation (includes padding/border) to avoid size calculation errors from default `content-box` |
| `line-height`              | `1.2`             | Fixed line height to eliminate vertical alignment shifts from dynamic line height changes |
| `img { display }`          | `inline-block`    | Avoid baseline alignment issues from `img` default `inline` element `vertical-align: baseline` |

**Notes**:

1. **Configuration consistency**: All export scenarios (single export, batch export) should use the same config to avoid alignment issues from different rendering logic.

2. **Wait adequately**: After changing page state (dynamic content loading, style changes), wait at least `1000ms` before capturing to ensure DOM and styles are fully stable.

3. **Clean up promptly**: Use `try...finally` to ensure temporary fix styles (`export-fix-style`) are removed after capture to avoid polluting normal page styles.

4. **Test thoroughly**: Cover "single export," "batch export," "complex layouts (images/text/nested elements)" to verify alignment consistency.

## Stage 4: Launch

---

## Stage 5: Troubleshooting

### Data Issues

#### Data keeps reverting automatically

Data keeps reverting? Use a separate admin panel for data management and separate model logic.

**Cause**:
Model code reinitializes old data when data loading fails.

**Solution**:
- **Use separate admin for data**: Separate data management from model logic
- **Let model modify data directly**: Ensure data modifications are handled directly by the model

**Prevention**:
- Use version control to save important states
- Regular data backups
- Implement data persistence mechanisms

---

#### Let the model modify data directly

Let the model modify data directly to reduce intermediate layers.

**Benefits**:
- Fewer data inconsistencies
- Lower error rate
- Simpler data flow

**Implementation**:
- Model directly operates database
- Avoid multi-layer data conversion
- Unify data modification entry point

---

### API Error Issues

#### AI feature errors

AI features failing? Check if request header parameters match request body serialization format.

**Common issues**:
- Headers causing body serialization issues
- Content-Type mismatch
- Data format errors

**Fix steps**:
1. Check request header parameters in API requests
2. Have AI identify unnecessary header parameters
3. Ensure header and body serialization formats match
4. Remove unnecessary header configurations

---

#### Ensure Content-Type matches

Remove unnecessary request header parameters and ensure Content-Type matches.

**Check points**:
- Is Content-Type correct?
- Does request body format match?
- Is encoding consistent?

**Common errors**:
- JSON data but Content-Type is text/plain
- Form data but Content-Type is application/json
- Encoding mismatch

---

### Credits Issues

#### Session errors after Credits top-up

Session errors after topping up Credits? Check logs → use Fix → retest.

**Fix steps**:
1. **Check logs**: Review system logs to confirm specific error after Credits top-up
2. **Use Fix**: Click the Fix button in superun to handle the error state
3. **Retest**: After fixing, retest to confirm session continues normally

**Prevention**:
- Check account status before topping up
- Wait for system sync after topping up
- Contact support if issues persist

---

### Deployment Issues

#### superun generates web apps

superun generates web applications, not native applications.

**Notes**:
- superun currently only generates web apps
- Cannot directly generate iOS or Android native apps
- Can adapt for mobile via responsive design

**Mobile solutions**:
- Responsive design
- Progressive Web Apps (PWA)
- Hybrid app frameworks

---

#### Admin system deployment

Need admin management features? superun adds admin routes in the same project. The key is configuring access permissions correctly.

**How it works**:
- superun adds admin management routes and pages to your project
- Admin features run in the same project as your main app, sharing the same domain and deployment address
- Frontend and admin are distinguished by route paths (e.g., `/admin` or `/dashboard`)

**Important: Configure access permissions**:
- **Set up authentication**: Ensure admin pages require login to access
- **Define role permissions**: Distinguish between admins and regular users—only admins can access admin features
- **Protect sensitive routes**: Use route guards or middleware to protect admin-related routes
- **Limit data access**: Ensure admin can only view and modify authorized data

**Steps**:
1. Ask superun to generate an admin management system (it will add the corresponding routes and pages)
2. Configure authentication and permission controls
3. Test access permissions to ensure only authorized users can access

> 💡 **Tip**: The admin system is part of your project and doesn't require separate deployment. The most important thing is to configure access permissions correctly to prevent unauthorized access.

---

#### Mobile experience optimization

Mobile experience? Use responsive design or Progressive Web Apps.

**Responsive design**:
- Adapt to different screen sizes
- Optimize touch interactions
- Adjust layout and font sizes

**Progressive Web Apps (PWA)**:
- Can be added to home screen
- Support offline access
- Provide near-native experience
- Push notification capabilities
