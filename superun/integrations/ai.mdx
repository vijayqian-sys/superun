Normally, adding AI to an app means hunting down API keys, setting up billing with providers, and wiring it all together yourself. superun AI makes it simple to quickly add powerful AI features to your web applications so you can start building smarter and more engaging apps right away. Some examples include:

* **AI-powered content generation** – automatically create engaging copy, blog posts, and marketing materials
* **Smart chatbots and assistants** – build conversational interfaces that understand context and provide helpful responses
* **Intelligent form handling** – auto-complete forms, validate inputs, and provide smart suggestions
* **Content analysis and insights** – understand user behavior, sentiment, and engagement patterns
* **Automated workflows** – trigger AI actions based on user interactions and data changes
* **Multilingual support** – automatically translate content and provide localized experiences
* **Image and document processing** – extract text, analyze content, and generate descriptions from uploaded files
* **Smart recommendations** – suggest relevant content, products, or actions based on user preferences
* **Automated testing and optimization** – AI-driven A/B testing and performance improvements

## Enabling superun AI

For the best experience, we recommend using superun AI with your Supabase integration for data persistence and user management.

superun AI is not enabled by default. It will automatically enable when you're developing related features, or you can manually enable it in Development → Services. You can manage AI behavior in your project settings.

### Default AI model

The default model varies depending on which superun domain you're using:
* **superun.ai** (International): Uses **Gemini 2.5 Flash** as the default model
* **superun.com** (China): Uses **Qwen3-Max** as the default model

If you want to use a different model or combination of models, you can specify your choice directly in your prompts or through the AI settings panel.

### AI Integration Options

Once superun AI is enabled, you can configure AI behavior in your project settings:

* **Always available**: superun automatically performs AI actions when requested, without additional confirmation.
* **Ask for confirmation**: superun asks for your approval before executing AI-powered features.
* **Disabled**: AI features are not available for the current project.

## Usage and Pricing

superun AI uses the same **Credits** system as the rest of superun. When you use AI features in conversations or build flows, they simply consume Credits from your project balance—there is no separate AI subscription or standalone AI invoice.

You can top up your Credits as needed, and all AI usage is counted together with your other superun activity. There is no per-model pricing UI or per-request line-item breakdown; instead, you just see your remaining Credits.

You can view and manage your Credits balance in the **Credits** section of your project dashboard.

## Supported AI Models

The default model varies depending on which superun domain you're using:
* **superun.ai** (International): Uses **Gemini 2.5 Flash** as the default model
* **superun.com** (China): Uses **Qwen3-Max** as the default model

You can specify different models in your prompts or through the AI settings.

### Domain-Specific Model Availability

The available AI models vary depending on which superun domain you're using:

* **superun.ai** (International): Supports GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 series, and other international models
* **superun.com** (China): Supports Qwen, GLM, DeepSeek, and other China-optimized models

The models listed below are available on **superun.ai**. For models available on **superun.com**, see the Chinese documentation.
