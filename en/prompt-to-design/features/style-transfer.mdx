Style Transfer lets you **generate a brand-new page** while **keeping the visual style of an existing Figma frame**.  
The AI will match the selected frame's colors, typography, spacing, and layout patterns.

Use **Style Transfer** when you want your new pages to instantly match the design system already in your file.

## 1. Select the **Style Transfer** tab

Open the **prompt.to.design** plugin, then click the **Style Transfer** tab at the top.  
This mode allows you to choose an existing frame as the visual reference.

## 2. Select a frame to use as your style reference

On your Figma canvas, click any existing frame that has the style you want to reuse.  
This frame will become your **style reference**, and its colors, typography, spacing, and component patterns will guide the generation.

<img
  src="/images/style-transfer/2_A.png"
  alt="Click a frame to set as style reference"
  width={600}
/>

<img
  src="/images/style-transfer/2_referenceframe.png"
  alt="Selected frame used as style reference"
  width={300}
/>

---

## 3. Describe the new page you want to generate

Type a **short description** of the new page layout you want.  
The AI will generate the page structure using the selected frame's style.

Example prompt:
> "Generate a hotel review details page, including comments with images and ratings."

<img
  src="/images/style-transfer/3.png"
  alt="Enter prompt for the new page while keeping the selected style"
  width={350}
/>


---

## 4. Click **Generate** and review the preview

Click **Generate** to start styling the new page.  
When the preview appears, you can scroll or zoom to inspect the AI-generated layout.

  width={700}
/>

## 5. Insert the styled layout into Figma

Click **Insert to Figma** to place the generated page into your canvas.  
A new frame will appear, styled consistently with your selected reference frame and fully editable.

  src="/images/style-transfer/6.png"
  alt="Insert styled layout into Figma as a new editable frame"
