Frame Redesign lets you take any existing Figma frame and instantly apply a new visual style with a short prompt.  

Instead of rebuilding layouts from scratch, you keep your structure and only refresh the look — perfect for redesigns, theme explorations, and light/dark mode variations.

## Step-by-step: How Frame Redesign works

### 1. Open Prompt.to.design and navigate to Frame Redesign

/>

Open the **Prompt.to.design** plugin in Figma, expand the **Features** menu, and select **Frame Redesign**.

### 2. Select a frame and describe your new style

/>

Select the frame you want to restyle on your Figma canvas, then write a short prompt describing the new visual direction you want — such as minimalist white, dark mode, or an iOS-style look.  

When ready, click **Generate** to generate your new version.

Example prompts:

- `Convert this screen to a clean, minimalist white style.`  
- `Turn this into a dark mode music app UI with neon accents.`  
- `Restyle this frame to match an iOS 17 flat, pastel look.`

### 3. Generate, import, and compare the result

/>

After the new style is generated, import it back into Figma with **Insert into Figma**.  

Place it next to your original frame to compare the before-and-after results, and iterate as needed to explore additional style directions.

Frame Redesign keeps your layout intact while refreshing the entire visual language — making style experiments fast, controlled, and fun.
