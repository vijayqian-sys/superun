## What is Nano Banana

Nano Banana is an advanced image model that you can use inside superun for AI-powered image generation and editing.  
superun connects to **Nano Banana** via API, so you can use Nano Banana’s native image capabilities directly inside your superun projects.

With Nano Banana, you can:

- Generate new images from text prompts (e.g. “cute cat in pixel-art style”)
- Edit existing images with natural language instructions (e.g. “change hair color to blue”, “repair and color this old photo”)
- Apply style transfers (e.g. “in the style of Starry Night”, “turn into LEGO minifigure”, “crocheted yarn doll”)
- Prepare product‑style mockups (e.g. turn a character into a boxed collectible figure)
- Drive image‑to‑video pipelines by first creating a key frame, then animating it in a separate step

The exact feature set may evolve over time. For the latest capabilities, check the **Nano Banana** tools and presets inside superun.

## Enabling Nano Banana in superun

You can turn Nano Banana on for a project from the **Build → Services** panel:

1. Open your project in superun.
2. Go to **Build → Services**.
3. Find **Nano Banana** in the services list and switch it **On** for the current project.
4. Follow any in‑product prompts to connect Nano Banana to the image tools or flows you want it to enhance.

## Example workflows

Here are some typical ways to use Nano Banana inside superun:

- **Image clean‑up & restoration**  
  Upload an old or damaged photo and ask Nano Banana to “repair scratches and colorize the photo”.

- **Product & marketing visuals**  
  Start from a character or object image and ask for “product showcase style with packaging and background props”.

- **Character & style exploration**  
  Keep the same character across multiple generations while changing outfits, poses, or styles (e.g. cyberpunk, LEGO, yarn doll).

- **Image‑to‑video pipelines**  
  First generate a key image with Nano Banana, then use a separate animation/video step to bring it to life (e.g. “smile, blink naturally, hair swaying in the breeze”).

Use these patterns as references and adjust prompts to match your brand, product, or creative direction.
