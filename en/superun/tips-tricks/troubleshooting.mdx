This document compiles common issues reported by users when using superun and their corresponding solutions to help you quickly identify and resolve problems.

## Data Rollback and Modification Issues

### Problem Description

Users report that modified content automatically reverts to the old version the next day, or content disappears and merges into other categories.

### Solution

Model code reinitializes old data when data loading fails. Recommended approaches:

- **Use a separate backend to manage data**: Separate data management from model logic to avoid reinitialization when data loading fails
- **Let the model modify data directly**: Ensure data modification operations are handled directly by the model to reduce data inconsistencies caused by intermediate steps

## AI Try-On Generation Failure

### Problem Description

Users report errors with the AI try-on generation feature, with multiple fixes proving ineffective.

### Solution

This issue is usually caused by `headers` parameters causing `body` serialization problems. Resolution steps:

1. Check the `headers` parameters in API requests
2. Have AI identify redundant `headers` parameters
3. Ensure `headers` and `body` serialization formats are consistent
4. Remove unnecessary `headers` configurations

## Errors After Credits Top-up

### Problem Description

Users report that sessions terminate abnormally after Credits top-up, preventing continued operations.

### Solution

1. **Check logs**: Review system logs to identify specific error messages after Credits top-up
2. **Use Fix**: Click the Fix button in superun to handle abnormal states
3. **Re-test**: After fixing, re-test to confirm the session can continue normally

> 💡 **Tip**: If the problem persists, contact technical support and provide relevant log information.

## Backend Address and APP Deployment Issues

### Problem Description

Users inquire about backend addresses and APP download methods.

### Solution

**Current Limitations**:

- superun currently can only generate **web applications**, not native APPs
- To deploy a backend management system, you need to **generate the backend first**, then proceed with other configurations
- Backend addresses will be provided after generation, with specific locations depending on your deployment method

**Recommended Process**:

1. First use superun to generate a backend management system
2. Obtain the backend access address
3. For mobile experience, consider using responsive design or PWA (Progressive Web App)

## Browser Compatibility Issues

### Problem Description

Safari (especially older versions, such as Safari 16.1 / macOS 13) cannot open the website, showing a blank page, or unable to access in certain network environments.

### Solution

1. **Recommended browsers**: Use mainstream browsers such as Chrome, Edge, Safari (newer versions)
2. **System upgrade**: Upgrade macOS system to get the latest version of Safari
3. **Network test**: Visit `https://net-test.superun.app/` to test network connection
4. **Device recommendation**: Try to use desktop for operations, as mobile and iPad adaptations are still being improved

## Preview and Operation Issues

### Problem Description

Preview cannot open but published links work normally, have Credits but cannot operate or type, preview stays in a certain state with no page changes, or features fail again after being fixed.

### Solution

1. **Preview cannot open**:
   - Check network connection, visit `https://net-test.superun.app/` to test
   - Try opening preview in a new page
   - If published links can be accessed, it may be a preview environment issue, refresh the browser

2. **Have Credits but cannot operate**:
   - Need to check "Generate Demo" first, then you can modify through dialogue after completion
   - Ensure the project has completed initial demo generation

3. **Preview state not updating**:
   - Click the "Fix" function to repair
   - Refresh the entire browser page (not the page refresh inside)
   - If "Execute" button appears after fixing, click it
   - Close browser and reopen the project

4. **Features repeatedly failing**:
   - AI may have reverted features in subsequent modifications
   - Use version history rollback to restore to a previously working version
   - Avoid repeatedly modifying in the same conversation, stop and change approach when issues are found

## Performance Optimization Issues

### Problem Description

Web pages load slowly, mobile version is slow.

### Solution

1. **Check network**: May be a network issue, suggest testing network speed
2. **Optimize images**: Images or files that are too large may cause slow loading, need to optimize image size
3. **Consult AI**: Describe the problem clearly, let AI provide optimization solutions
4. **Consider user experience**: Cannot require all users to have fast internet, need to consider loading performance when designing

---

## Network Errors and Task Stuck Issues

### Problem Description

Frequently pop up "Network Error" prompts, or tasks stay in "Reading console logs" process.

### Solution

1. **Network errors**: May be due to high request volume, wait a moment; if it persists, contact technical support
2. **Task stuck**: Contact technical support and provide project link
