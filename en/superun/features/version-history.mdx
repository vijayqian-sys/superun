## How Version History Rollback Works

Version History Rollback allows you to view and restore previous versions of your project. Every time you make changes to your project, superun automatically saves a version snapshot, giving you the ability to use **version history rollback** to revert to any previous state.

This feature is essential for:
- **Recovering from unwanted changes** — quickly restore a previous working version
- **Exploring different directions** — try changes knowing you can always go back
- **Collaboration safety** — maintain a record of all project iterations

## Accessing Version History Rollback

To use the version history rollback feature, first access your project's version history:

1. Click the **version history icon** (located in the interface, typically in the top toolbar or sidebar)

2. The version history panel will open, displaying a list of all saved versions with timestamps

## Using Version History Rollback to Restore a Previous Version

**Version history rollback** is the recommended way to safely restore your project to a previous state. Once you've accessed the version history:

1. **Browse the version list** — review all available versions with their creation dates and times

2. **Select the version** you want to restore by clicking on it

3. **Click "Restore this version"** button on the right side of the selected version to perform the version history rollback

/>

4. Your project will immediately switch back to the selected version, restoring all elements, styles, and configurations from that point in time

## Important Notes

- **Version history rollback is immediate** — your current project state will be replaced by the selected version
- **All versions are preserved** — you can use version history rollback to restore to any version at any time, even after restoring to an older version
- **No data loss** — previous versions remain accessible in the history, so you can always switch between different versions
- **External data is not restored** — version history rollback only affects your project's UI, styles, and configurations. **External data sources such as Supabase databases and other integrated services are not restored** — they remain in their current state regardless of which version you roll back to
