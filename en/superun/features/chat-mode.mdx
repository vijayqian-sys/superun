**Ask** is a conversation-only mode that allows you to consult with superun AI about your project without triggering any edits, UI regeneration, or changes to your current page.

## What is Ask?

When **Ask** is selected in the bottom-right corner, anything you type will be treated as a conversation only. It **won't trigger edits, regenerate UI, or apply changes** to the current page.

This mode is **completely free** and designed to help you understand your project better before making any modifications.

## Why use Ask?

Ask is perfect for:

* **Understanding your project's current state** – Ask questions about your codebase, components, structure, and implementation details
* **Getting recommendations** – Receive suggestions on best practices, architecture improvements, or feature implementations
* **Planning next steps** – Discuss potential modifications, refactoring strategies, or new features before implementing them
* **Troubleshooting** – Get help diagnosing issues, understanding errors, or identifying potential problems
* **Learning and exploration** – Ask questions about how things work, explore different approaches, or understand technical concepts

## Workflow: Ask first, then modify

The recommended workflow is to use Ask first, then switch to normal mode for actual modifications:

1. **Start with Ask**
   - Ask questions about your project's current state
   - Understand what needs to be changed and why
   - Get recommendations on the best approach
   - Clarify any doubts or concerns

2. **Switch to normal mode for modifications**
   - Once you have a clear understanding and plan
   - Switch back to normal mode to implement changes
   - Apply the insights gained from the Ask session

This approach helps you make informed decisions and avoid unnecessary changes or iterations.
