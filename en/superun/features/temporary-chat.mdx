During the **generation of 4 styles** phase, style generation may take some time. To make the wait more productive, superun automatically provides a **free temporary chat** with an AI consultant.

## What is Temporary Chat?

When superun is generating styles for your project, clicking the input field will automatically open a temporary chat interface. This allows you to interact with the AI consultant **completely free of charge** while waiting for the generation to complete.

## Key Features

* **Completely free** – No Credits or charges for using temporary chat during generation
* **Automatic activation** – Chat automatically opens when you click the input field during generation
* **Product and design consultation** – Ask questions about your product and design while waiting
* **Non-blocking** – Generation continues in the background while you chat
* **Dismissible** – You can close the chat banner if you prefer to wait without chatting

## When Does It Appear?

The temporary chat becomes available during the **generation of 4 styles** phase. Since the generation process may take some time, clicking the input field will open the chat interface to help you make productive use of the waiting period.

## What Can You Ask?

During the temporary chat, you can:

* **Discuss your project goals** – Share ideas about what you want to build
* **Get design recommendations** – Ask for suggestions on layout, colors, or UI elements
* **Clarify requirements** – Better understand what you need before generation completes
* **Learn about features** – Ask questions about superun's capabilities
* **Plan next steps** – Think ahead about what you'll do after generation finishes

## How to Use

1. **Wait for generation to start** – Style generation begins with 4 stages
2. **See the notification banner** – A banner appears: "Generating styles may take some time. Feel free to chat in the dialog first."
3. **Click the input field** – Clicking the input field automatically opens the temporary chat dialog

4. **Ask questions** – Type your questions in the chat input field
5. **Continue chatting** – The chat remains available throughout the generation process

## Difference from Ask

**Temporary Chat** (this feature):
* Automatically opens when clicking the input field during style generation
* Available only during the generation wait time
* Focused on product and design questions during the build process

**Ask** (separate feature):
* Manually activated by selecting it in the bottom-right corner
* Available at any time, not just during generation
* Designed for understanding your project without making changes

Both features are completely free and complement each other in different scenarios.
