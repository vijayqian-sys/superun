## How Design Options Work

Design Options is a design exploration step in superun's generation workflow—it occurs **before** building the complete interface.

superun doesn't immediately generate a single interface—instead, it first produces **four different design options** based on your prompt and product requirements. Each option reflects a different layout style, visual direction, and interpretation of your intended product identity.

This gives you meaningful choices early in the process, reduces rework, and ensures superun builds the final interface according to the direction you select.

**Note:** Design Options is part of the initial generation process. It does not create separate project copies or allow you to maintain multiple versions simultaneously. It's a selection step that determines the design direction for your single project.

## Design Options Workflow

### 1. Initial Prompt & Clarification
superun may ask a few quick clarification questions after your initial prompt to better understand product goals, audience, and visual tone.  
These answers guide the creation of the four design options.

### 2. Generate Four Design Options  
superun produces **four distinct style options**, each showcasing a different structural and visual interpretation of your project.  
This allows you to compare overall direction at a glance.

### 3. Review & Adjust  
Browse the four design options and identify the direction that best matches your vision.  
If a specific option preview is not ideal, you can now **regenerate that single preview card without restarting the entire process**.

### 4. Select Design Option  
When you select your preferred design option, superun uses its style as the foundation for all subsequent layout generation and refinement.

You can also **return to this design option selection step at any time**, even after building, editing, or modifying your project.

This allows you to update the overall design direction whenever needed without starting from scratch.

## Final Result

By selecting a design option—and optionally regenerating individual previews—you establish a clear design direction early in the process.

superun then generates a complete and consistent interface aligned with that direction.  

And because you can **revisit and change your selected design option at any time**, your project remains flexible, allowing the entire generation workflow to evolve with your product needs.
