Code Mode allows you to **view your project's code** directly. You can switch to Code Mode by clicking the toggle in the **Build** tab.

> **Note**: Code Mode features (including viewing and downloading code) require a **paid subscription**. Free users cannot access Code Mode.

## How to Use Code Mode

1. Navigate to the **Build** tab in your project
2. Click the **Code Mode** toggle to switch from visual view to code view
3. Browse and inspect your project's code structure
4. To download code, click the download button (requires paid user permission)

Code Mode provides a read-only view of your code, making it easy to understand the structure and implementation of your project.
