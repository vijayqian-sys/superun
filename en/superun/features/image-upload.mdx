While using **superun**, you can upload images directly in the chat input at the bottom of the screen.

Images help superun better understand your ideas, references, or visual intent, whether you’re explaining a layout, sharing inspiration, or clarifying a specific detail.

You can upload images **at any time** during the workflow, without interrupting your current progress.
