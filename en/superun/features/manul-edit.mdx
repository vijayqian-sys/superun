## Overview

**Manul Edit** lets you **manually fine‑tune a single page** after AI has generated it.

You can:

- Adjust layout and styles (colors, font sizes, alignment, borders, image edits, etc.)
- Edit copy directly in a WYSIWYG view
- Apply your changes back to the project, or discard them for this session only

> Manul Edit is **completely free to use** and **does not consume any Credits**.  
> It operates on the **current page only** and does not automatically change other pages in the project.

---

## How to use Manul Edit

### 1. Start from Preview

On the project page, go to the **Preview** tab and wait for the page to fully load.

At the **top‑right corner**, you’ll see the button:

- **Select element and edit** (icon button in the toolbar)

/>

### 2. Select an element

Click **Select element and edit**, then move your cursor over the page.

- Elements will be highlighted with green outlines
- When you click an element, a small dialog appears next to it

In that dialog, click **Manul Edit** to open the Manul Edit editor for the selected element and page.

> Only users with edit permission (owner / editor) and a fully loaded preview can see and use this entry point.

## When Manul Edit Is Allowed

The **Manul Edit** entry is only enabled when all of the following are true:

- **Permissions**
  - Your role in the project is **owner** or **editor**
  - View‑only roles (viewer) cannot enter edit mode

- **Page state**
  - Preview has finished loading
  - The current session has already generated a page and there is a valid `codePath`
  - The project is **past the style/theme selection step** 

- **Editing flow**
  - You are not currently editing 
  - The previous “enter editor” flow has finished 
  - No “Update Prototype” action is still running 

On first use, a short **editing tip dialog** may pop up asking you to scroll through the page once before editing. Confirm to continue.

---

## When Manul Edit Is Not Available

The **Select element and edit** / **Manul Edit** buttons are disabled or will not open the editor in these cases. In all of these states, the **Select element and edit** entry in the top‑right toolbar is shown as disabled, and only becomes clickable again after the relevant conversation or system flow has finished and the page is fully ready:

- **No edit permission**
  - You are not an owner/editor (e.g. invited as read‑only)

- **Page not ready**
  - Preview is still loading or the preview service is starting right after publish
  - The session has not yet generated a page (`codePath` is missing)
  - The project is still on the “choose style / theme” step

- **Conversation flow still running**
  - There is an ongoing AI conversation / generation flow that has not finished yet

- **Editing flow conflicts**
  - The editor is still entering (previous click is initializing)
  - A previous **Update Prototype** is still in progress
  - You are already in edit mode; clicking again works as **exit**, not as a new editing session

## Editing in Manul Edit

Once inside Manul Edit, the screen is split into:

- **Left panel** – style controls for the selected element:
  - Text color, background color
  - Font size, weight, alignment
  - Border width, style, color
  - Other layout and visual options
- **Right side** – live preview of the current page
- **Top‑right** – **Apply changes** button

  alt="Manul Edit layout and style panel"
  width={1100}
/>

You can freely tweak values in the left panel and immediately see the result in the live preview. After there are pending edits, two buttons — **Restore** and **Save as draft** — will appear in the bottom bar so you can keep a draft before deciding whether to apply it.

> **Note**: Available style controls in the left panel are dynamically displayed based on the selected element type.  
> - **This content is dynamically controlled by product logic. Please exit and modify via chat.**

### Example: Emphasize a button

For example, select the **“Mobile”** button in a pricing/estimation page and change:

- Background color to a red tone
- Border color to a matching accent

## Editor Actions: Restore, Save as draft, Apply changes, Exit

At the bottom (and top‑right), you’ll see a set of actions that control **how** your Manul Edit changes are applied.

### 1. Restore

- **What it does**: Undo all changes made in the **current editing session** that have not been applied yet.
- **Effect**: The page returns to the state when you first opened Manul Edit.
- **Scope**: Only affects this session’s unsaved edits; it does **not** roll back earlier versions that were already applied to the project.

### 2. Save as draft

- **What it does**: Temporarily save your style / layout edits into the **current editing session**, and reflect them in the right‑hand preview.
- **Important**: These changes are **not yet written back to the project**.
- You can press **Save as draft** multiple times; each successful draft increments the counter on **Apply changes**.

### 3. Apply changes / Apply N changes

- Initial state: **Apply changes** is disabled when there is no draft.
- After at least one **Save as draft**:
  - The button becomes **“Apply 1 changes”**, **“Apply 2 changes”**, etc.
  - The button is highlighted and clickable.
- When you click it:
  - All N changes are written back to the project (updating the page prototype/code)
  - A success toast such as **“Changes saved”** appears
  - The counter resets to zero and the button returns to the disabled “Apply changes” state.

/>

### 4. Exit

- **What it does**: Exit the Design Editor and return to Preview.
- **If there are no un‑applied changes**:
  - The editor closes directly.
- **If there are un‑applied drafts**:
  - A confirmation dialog appears:
    - **Exit anyway** – discard all un‑applied edits for this session
    - **Apply changes and exit** – apply all pending changes first, then close

## What Happens After You Apply or Discard

### If you **Apply changes**

- Manul Edit sends the updated UI structure back to superun.
- The current project’s prototype is updated for this page:
  - Future Preview sessions use this new version
  - Build code view is based on this version
  - AI continue‑editing uses this as the new baseline

In other words: from this moment on, the **“source of truth”** for this page is the manually tuned version you just saved.

### If you **Discard changes**

- The current editing session is discarded.
- No changes from this session are written back to the project.
- The page returns to its pre‑editor state; AI and code continue to work on the previously saved version.

### If there is an error or interruption

- If the browser tab is closed or network fails during **entering Manul Edit** or **updating prototype**:
  - The current editing round might not be saved.
  - The system resets intermediate “entering edit” states, so you can click the Design Editor button again later to retry.

- If you have **saved drafts (Save as draft) but have not yet applied them**, and then refresh the page or leave midway, you may see a temporary mismatch when you come back:
  - The **Preview page** may still show the version **before** your drafts were saved.
  - After re‑entering Manul Edit, the editor may show the version **with** your saved drafts.
  - In other words, the same page can briefly look different between Preview and the Manul Edit editor.

  If this happens, you can resolve it by:
  - **Use the version history rollback feature**: Use **version history rollback** to restore to a confirmed good version. This is the recommended approach, as it safely reverts to a previous stable state.
  - Sending a chat instruction such as **"deploy directly, skip checks"** to ask superun to deploy the current version immediately while **skipping the longer debug/check phase**.
