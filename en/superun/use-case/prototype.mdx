## Quick flow
1. Create a new blank project in superun
2. Connect Supabase (project URL / API Key)
3. Break requirements into small chunks, generate a plan via Chat, confirm, then execute
4. Use Editable Design to adjust UI and responsiveness
5. Publish and run regression checks

## Supabase basics
- Organization and Project → get URL and Key
- Enable email login (you can disable verification emails initially)
- Design table schemas and RLS policies

## Typical pages
- Dashboard (lists/stats)
- Editor (title/tags/content area)
- Settings (profile and API config)

## Debugging tips
- Investigate first, then fix; roll back to a working version if needed
- Use version diffs to locate changes and regressions
