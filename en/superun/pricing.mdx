You can filter and search through both consumption and session details to analyze your usage patterns and optimize your Credits spending.

## How Credits Work

superun uses **Credits** as a unified usage metric across features.  
Instead of separate AI or feature-specific bills, you simply consume Credits from your project balance.

Credits may be used for:

- Running AI-powered conversations and flows
- Generating or regenerating interfaces and branches
- Performing certain resource-intensive operations (as indicated in the UI)
- Using plugins and integrations (such as superun Cloud, superun AI, Stripe, Nano Banana, etc.), which convert their usage into Credits and deduct from your project balance

There is **no separate AI subscription** or model-by-model invoice. You only track and top up your Credits.

## Invite Friends and Earn Credits

You can earn **20 Credits** by inviting friends to superun. Here's how it works:

1. **Get your invite link**: Find your unique invite link in your account settings or on the homepage.
2. **Share with friends**: Send your invite link to friends who want to try superun.
3. **Friend completes registration**: Your friend registers through your invite link.
4. **Friend completes a demo**: Your friend needs to:
   - Enter a requirement in superun
   - Generate four style options
   - Select one style and complete the demo application
5. **You receive 20 Credits**: Once your friend completes the demo, you'll automatically receive 20 Credits in your account.

The Credits will be added to your balance immediately and can be used for any superun features.
