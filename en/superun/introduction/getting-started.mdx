superun turns your idea into a working product through four clear stages:

**Idea → Preview → Build → Launch**

Each stage focuses on a different type of decision, so you always know what to do next.

---

## Step 1 · Idea  
### Turn an idea into a product blueprint

Start by describing what you want to build.

- Write a prompt explaining your product idea
- Answer a few refinement questions
- superun organizes your inputs into a structured project baseline

At the end of this step, you have a clear, generation-ready product direction.

## Step 2 · Preview  
### Explore, edit, and refine your product visually

Before building features, superun lets you see and shape your product visually.

- Start by reviewing four design branches to choose an initial direction
- Explore a live, full-page preview of your product
- Freely modify your UI using Editable Design tools
- Select elements directly and adjust layout, content, spacing, and styles
- Describe changes in natural language and let superun update the UI for you

After this step, you’ll have a visual direction and UI structure you feel confident building on.

## Step 3 · Build  
### Define features, logic, and integrations

In Build, you decide what your product can do and how it's powered.

- The Feature List selects the core functions your product likely needs
- Each feature selection automatically generates the required UI, data models, and backend logic

Platform services & integrations include:

- superun Cloud: authentication, database, and backend capabilities
- superun AI: AI-powered interactions and generation
- Stripe: payments and subscriptions
- Nano Banana- AI image generation
- Supabase — external database and backend integration

All services are configured to work together, so frontend and backend stay aligned.

> 💡 **Understanding the workflow**: In superun, you'll encounter three key concepts:
> - **Demo**: Pure frontend, used only to validate ideas and workflows, uses fake data
> - **Prototype**: Same as Demo, does not include development
> - **Development**: Connects real capabilities (such as sending emails) to become a product that can actually serve other users
> 
> Conditions for completing a demo: After registering through an invite link, enter requirements in superun, generate four styles, select one style and execute to completion.

## Step 4 · Launch  
### Publish, optimize, and monitor

When your project is ready, it’s time to go live.

- Set site title, description, and social preview
- Configure SEO and domain settings
- Publish and share your project
- Monitor performance and analytics

Your product is now live, searchable, and measurable.
