# Ready-to-use API Keys

We provide ready-to-use API keys that you can use for testing your integrations. These keys allow you to quickly get started without needing to set up your own API credentials.

<Warning>
  **Important**: These API keys are shared among all users and are intended for testing purposes only. They may become unavailable due to:
  
  - High usage from multiple users
  - Provider rate limits or restrictions
  - Changes in provider policies
  
  For production use, we strongly recommend using your own API keys.
</Warning>
