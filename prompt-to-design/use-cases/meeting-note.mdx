title: "Turn meeting notes into UI mockups"
---


## Scenario
Your PM just said: “We need a new Rewards page with badges, progress, and history.”

## Challenge
Turning messy meeting notes into usable UI is slow and repetitive.

## How prompt.to.design helps

- Paste meeting notes directly into the prompt  
- The plugin interprets the content and identifies structure  
- Generates a clean, sectionized UI layout in seconds  

<img
  src="/images/meeting-note/1.png"
  alt="Pasting meeting notes into prompt"
  style={{ marginTop: '1rem', borderRadius: '8px' }}
/>

- Generation begins. The right panel shows AI’s interpretation and breakdown of the notes.

<img

  alt="AI interpreting meeting notes"
  style={{ marginTop: '1rem', borderRadius: '8px' }}
/>

- Review the generated layout, refine details, or **Import to Figma**

<img
  src="/images/meeting-note/3.png"
  alt="Preview of UI generated from notes"
  style={{ marginTop: '1rem', borderRadius: '8px' }}
/>

## ✔ A ready-to-review screen generated just minutes after the meeting

  alt="Final UI created from meeting notes"
  style={{ marginTop: '1rem', borderRadius: '8px' }}
/>
