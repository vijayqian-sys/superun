title: "Expand multi-page flows quickly"
---


## Scenario
You need 10–20 pages for a complete user flow.

## Challenge
Designing each page manually drastically slows the project.

## How prompt.to.design helps

- Use one well-designed page as a reference  
- Enter your first prompt to generate Page A  
- Then enter your second prompt to generate Page B  
- Both pages inherit the same layout system and visual style  

### First prompt (Page A)

<img
  src="/images/expand/1_A.png"
  alt="Generating page A from reference"
  style={{ marginTop: '1rem', borderRadius: '8px' }}
/>

### Second prompt (Page B)

<img
  src="/images/expand/1_B.png"
  alt="Generating page B from the same reference"
  style={{ marginTop: '1rem', borderRadius: '8px' }}
/>

- When both pages are generated, you can combine them to expand your multi-page flow quickly.
