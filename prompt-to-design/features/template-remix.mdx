Template Remix allows you to take any existing layout template and instantly generate a new, branded version of it — using your own prompt, content, and visual direction.

This feature is perfect for designers who want speed, consistency, and creative control directly inside Figma.

## Step-by-step: How Template Remix works

### **1. Open Template Remix in the plugin**

From the top navigation of the plugin interface, click **Template Remix**.  

Then click **Select templates**, and you’ll see a panel of available templates organized by categories such as **Home**, **Sign-in**, **Dashboard**, and **Products**.

### **2. Browse templates and choose one to remix**

Click any template card to preview it. The preview helps you understand the layout and structure before generating your own version.


### **3. Describe your new design using a prompt**

In the description box, write a simple prompt explaining what you want to create.


### **4. Click "Remix" to generate your new layout**

superun analyzes the template → applies your prompt → produces a fresh design based on your structure and content needs.

You can regenerate as many variations as you like.


### **5. Insert the result into Figma**

When you find a version you like, click **Insert into Figma**.  
This adds the generated layout directly to your current canvas, fully editable and ready for refinement.

## Tips for best results

- Be clear about your product’s purpose in the prompt  
- Mention the tone or visual mood (e.g., minimal, playful, futuristic, warm)  
- Specify must-have sections if needed (CTA, form fields, hero text, etc.)  
- Generate multiple variations to explore different directions

## Summary

Template Remix gives you a fast, powerful way to adapt professional templates into your own branded layouts — all within a few seconds and without rebuilding UI structures manually.

Try experimenting with different prompts and templates to discover even more layout possibilities.
