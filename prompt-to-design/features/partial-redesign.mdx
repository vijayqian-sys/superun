title: Partial Redesign
---

import Image from '@/components/Image';

Partial Redesign lets you update **one specific area** of a frame without affecting the rest of your layout.  
This is useful when you want to refresh a card, redesign a section, or explore variations while keeping your page structure intact.

---

## 1. Select the **Partial Redesign** tab

Open the **prompt.to.design** plugin and click the **Partial Redesign** tab.  
This mode allows you to pick an existing area inside a frame and regenerate just that part.

## 2. Select a frame that contains the region you want to redesign

To begin, you must select an entire **frame** on your Figma canvas.  
The plugin needs to know which page you want to work inside before you can choose a specific region.

### Why this step matters:

- Region Redesign **only works when a frame is selected first**  
- If no frame is selected, the plugin cannot enter region-selection mode  
- Once a frame is selected, the plugin will show the message:  
  **"Select a region in the frame"**

  src="/images/region-redesign/2_A.png"
  alt="Click on a frame to enable region selection mode"
  width={600}
/>

<img
  src="/images/region-redesign/2_frame.png"
  alt="Example of a selected frame that will be used for region redesign"
  width={500}
/>

---

## 3. Select a region inside the frame

After selecting a frame, click on the specific area you want to redesign - for example, a card, a section, or a content block.

  src="/images/region-redesign/3_A.png"
  alt="Plugin shows the selected region after a frame area is chosen"
  width={600}
/>

### Recommended method (especially for beginners):
**Use the left-side Figma Layer Panel to select the exact region.**

This ensures you pick the correct component or container even when layers are nested.

  alt="Use the Layer Panel or canvas to select a specific region inside the frame"

/>

## 4. Describe what you want to update in the selected region

Type a short prompt describing how you want the selected area to be redesigned.  
Only the chosen region will be updated - the rest of your page stays unchanged.

Example prompt:
> "Redesign this rating card into a premium, luxury hotel style.  
Use warm tones, soft elevation, and refined typography. Keep all content, but make it feel elegant and high-end."

  src="/images/region-redesign/4.png"
  alt="Enter a description of how to redesign the selected region"
  width={350}
/>

---

## 5. Generate and review redesigned previews

Click **Generate** to create new variations of the selected region.  
The preview will show new designs that match your frame's existing style system.

You can scroll or zoom to compare different versions.

/>

---

## 6. Insert the redesigned region into Figma

Click **Insert to Figma** to apply the new version.  
Only the selected area will be replaced - the rest of the frame will remain exactly the same.

The updated region will appear as fully editable Figma layers.
